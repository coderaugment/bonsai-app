2. Or run a local server: `python3 -m http.server 8080` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## What's Included

This directory contains 10 distinct logo concept explorations for **Bonsai Developer OS**:

### Visual Files (SVG Format)
- `concept-03-growth-stack.svg` - Abstract layered design representing tech stack
- `concept-04-pruning-shears.svg` - Tool-focused icon emphasizing cultivation
- `concept-05-pot-sprout.svg` - Pot + sprout representing potential and environment
- `concept-07-branch-network.svg` - Network diagram showing multi-agent architecture
- `concept-08-wordmark.svg` - Typography-focused design with "ai" accent
- `concept-10-zen-circle.svg` - Ensō circle with minimal tree (Zen aesthetic)

### Gallery
- `index.html` - Interactive visual gallery displaying all 10 concepts with descriptions

## Concept Categories

The 10 concepts explore five design direction axes:

1. **Literal → Abstract**: From realistic tree depictions to symbolic representations
2. **Organic → Digital**: From natural imagery to tech/AI visual language
3. **Single Tree → Garden/Network**: From individual to collective/multi-agent metaphors
4. **Growth → Cultivation**: From passive imagery to active tool/process representation
5. **Eastern → Western**: From traditional Japanese aesthetics to modern tech branding

## Review Process

**For stakeholders reviewing these concepts:**

1. **Open the visual gallery** (`index.html`) to see all concepts side-by-side
2. **Consider these criteria:**
   - Brand recognition and memorability
   - Scalability (works at 16px favicon size and large formats)
   - Alignment with Bonsai's AI + cultivation identity
   - Distinctiveness in the developer tools landscape
   - Versatility across light/dark themes

3. **Select 2-3 favorites** for full mockup generation
4. **Provide feedback** on what resonates and what doesn't

## Next Steps

After concept selection:
1. Generate full-color variations and light/dark mode versions
2. Create mockups in application contexts (header, favicon, loading screen)
3. Test at various sizes and on different backgrounds
4. Refine chosen direction based on stakeholder feedback

## Technical Details
